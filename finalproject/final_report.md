### Project title: Half-edge Data Structure using BGL

#### Brief Summary of Goals
The main goal of this project is to implement a light-weight generic half-edge data structure using BGL. Half-edge data structure is an important data structure for representing and manipulating 3D mesh data in computational geometry. A generic implementation of half-edge data structure could be used in various computational geometry algorithms, including mesh simplification, repair and constructive solid geometry, that rely on this data structure. We will demonstrate the power of this generic implementation using sample algorithms such as mesh simplification and Laplacian deformation.
